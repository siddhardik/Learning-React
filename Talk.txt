To install React , First install Node Js

then in command Prompt  write ->  npm i -g create-react-app  

// To create react app  - > create-react-app  app_name
// For VS Code Terminal -> npx create-react-app app_name
// to Run react-app => npm start

JavaScript Libraries = > VUE,  React , Jquery

// We can create website user interface by html css And JavaScript but later to change somewhere, 
it would be 
complex   due to poor folder structure and huge number of codes
// Use JavaScript Libraries , Above Things are easier  code will be easier than prior.

// Benifits Of JavaScript Library

1] Well Document structure
2] Reusibility Of Code
3] Single Page Application

Loader will be loaded at once for single page application
 Will be requested to change A specific Portion that to be needed 

 Framework -- Maximum Functionality is Predefined which will be used to craete website 
 Example => Angular Framework , Which was developed by Google

 Library --- We have to write Custom Functionality for each
 Example => React Library , Which Was developed by Facebook

 Folder => node_modules - All other Javascript libraries's Code 
 Pulic - photo video audio fabicon all are here
 Package.json => All dependecies And Project Details
 Lock.json => Used Libraray Tree
 src=> All Custom Code We will write here
 
 What is JavaSCript Module?
 Its A special type of file Which has an Access to other files' data.

 import keyword is used in Module file

 component import Name And call should be capital

import ShoePart from './Footer.js';   // Import
<ShoePart/>  // Calling

React has a default Module Which name is index.js

// To Install router
npm install react-router-dom
 <Route path="/">
                    <h1>Welcome To HomePage</h1>
   </Route>

Here path is Property in React Not Attribute

In react-router-dom v6, "Switch" is replaced by routes "Routes".
                
exact also a property
exact   or exact="true"  are same

If route is of two words or more write hyphen   word-word-word

import <Navbar> from"./components/Navbar/Navbar";
first letter of < > Should be in capital.  [ Inside index.js]

any thing inside public folder will be accesible directly via url
http://localhost:3000/logo192.png  in this way

Use Image in website via public folder  <li> <a href="#"><img src="logo192.png" width="40" /></a></li>
 <li> <a href="#"><img src={myphoto} width="40" /></a></li>  // private Way

 <BrowserRouter>
               <Routes>
               <Route path="/" element={
                <h1> This is HomePage</h1>
               }/>
               <Route path="/images" element={
                <h1> This is images' Page</h1>
               }/>
               
               </Routes>
               </BrowserRouter> 

if we use <a> Tag then Loader in website will be loaded per page's request.

use link tag 
We can not directly use link tag outside BrowserRouter 

BrowserRouter as BR "In this way we short "

use className instead of class its raect rule  .Otherwise you will se  error on browser console 

{} called Template Literal

Function Pass in Event Not ()
